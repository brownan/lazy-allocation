    "# The Lazy Portfolio Allocation Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lazy Portfolio Allocation Algorithm, first described by Albert H. Mao [1], is a way of keeping your portfolio balanced with regular contributions or withdraws, without the need for any explicit balancing operations. It takes a list of assets (which could be funds, accounts, etc), their current values, and their target or *desired* allocation percentage, as well as an amount to contribute. The algorithm then calculates the optimal way to split up the contribution between the assets such as to minimize each asset's deviation from the desired allocation.\n",

At the end, the delta values are explicitly rounded to two decimal places, partly to account for 0% allocations, but also just because currency values are typically only useful to two decimal places. The downside is that the total of all delta values may not exactly sum to the given contribution; it may be off by 0.01. For example, if contributing $100 to three assets, the values would be 33.33, 33.33, and 33.33, totaling 99.99.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is not desired, the rounding may be removed. Then the answer would be 100/3 for the above example.\n",
    "\n",
    "When porting the code to an environment which lacks a comparible exact arithmetic library, the algorithm will still work, but rounding errors may cause slightly less precise results."
